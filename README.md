# Chess-Console-Application

Implemented in **C#** with a focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**, this chess console application offers a clean and modular

design for easy maintenance and extensibility. This application allows you to play chess in the **command-line interface**. 

It's a simple yet fun way to enjoy the classic game of chess.

## Introduction

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The game is played by 

millions of people worldwide, and it's known for its deep strategy and complexity. If you're unfamiliar with the rules of chess,

## Features

###  Play chess against another human player.
###  Basic chess rules implemented, including pawn promotion, castling, en passant, check and Checkmate.
###  Various types of draws (stalemate, threefold repetition, fifty-move rule and more) are implemented.
###  ASCII art representation of the chessboard for visualization.
###  Command-line interface for ease of use.



## How to Play

The game is played by entering commands in the command-line interface.

Each player takes turns to make a move by entering the origin and destination squares of the piece they want to move.

Follow the standard algebraic notation for moves **(e.g., "e2e4" to move the pawn from e2 to e4)**.

Example of castling: **"e1g1" (for white kingside castling) or "e8g8" (for black kingside castling)**.
